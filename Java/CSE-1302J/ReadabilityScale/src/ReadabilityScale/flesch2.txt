Firefighters on Sunday battled to contain several wildfires that had blackened 
thousands of acres and forced scores of people to evacuate their homes.  
Nearly 700 firefighters converged on a blaze in the Angeles National Forest that had burned 
1,200 acres near the Los Angeles suburb of Castaic and destroyed two outbuildings.  
The firefighters faced temperatures of nearly 100 degrees.  
The fire, reported Saturday afternoon, was expected to be fully contained late Sunday, 
said Dianne Cahir, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman. The cause remained under investigation. 
On Saturday, the fire briefly threatened a mobile home park, but residents using garden hoses 
kept it at bay. They were evacuated but allowed to return after the flames passed. No homes 
were threatened Sunday, Cahir said.  
Firefighters expected to extinguish the remains of three Northern California wildfires 
that began Friday and consumed more than 4,000 acres near Angels Camp, about 110 miles 
east of San Francisco. 
The largest blaze charred more than 3,400 acres near Copperopolis, apparently sparked by 
a mechanical problem with a passing car. It forced the evacuation of about 210 people. 
It was 90 percent contained Sunday. 
A fire near Avery was 65 percent contained after destroying two homes and charring nearly 
900 acres. The third blaze had covered less than 100 acres and was 90 percent contained. 
Causes of the blazes had not been determined.
